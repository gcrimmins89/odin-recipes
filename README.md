This project is a short introduction to HTML.

The website will draw upon my learnings to date with respect to the command line, git and HTML.

Upon completion, I will have demonstrated the skills necessary to git and associated learnings, command line and HTML lists, images, links, paragraphs, headings and the boilerplate.
